                Your support can be life-changing literally for hundreds of children and families. At CEF International, we know that nothing makes good programs like good information. In this way, we are able to gather and analyse information in order to build on and refine our efforts based on their effectiveness in creating real change. Running with the idea that every child is the world changer, CEF International makes it its business to ensure such potential is tapped. Using our Evidence & Use process, we can evaluate the effectiveness of our programs and modify them to meet the child development needs.
